.D.....D.
E.......E
.D.....D.
..C...C..
...B.B...
....A....


This is the print diamond for 'C'.

Your diamond must contain spaces where there are dots.



Retro:

How did that feel?
- Cumbersome +1
- Rewarding +1
- Good, Surprising (Gitpod) +2
- Proud
- More mature (with gitpod)
- Disappointed about whitespace handling in multiline Strings

What worked well, need to do it more?
- Consistent with Rotation
- TDD Bootsrap Script +2
- Using Refactoring tools of VS Code
- Look into Gitpod workspaces
- Split Screen
